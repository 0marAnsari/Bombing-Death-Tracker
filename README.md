An R Shiny Web Application tracking bombings and deaths, using the ACLED API, in Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, and Israel as a result of IDF bombings.

This is the first iteration of a personal project, I aim for a more ambitious tracker of global interstate and intrastate violence using open-source data.

This is to build R-coding skills, shiny expertise, and further understandings of global conflict and the true human toll of warfare.

The database will be updated as soon as ACLED updates the API.
