An R Shiny Web Application mapping bombings and tracking deaths, using the ACLED API, in Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, and Israel as a result of IDF bombings since October 7th. In addition to the IDF tracker, any data from ACLED about Hamas and Hezbollah actors resulting in any fatalities have been listed.

This is the first iteration of a personal project, I aim for a more ambitious tracker of global interstate and intrastate violence using open-source data.

This is to build R-coding skills, shiny expertise, and further understandings of global conflict and the true human toll of warfare.

The database will be updated as soon as ACLED updates the API.
