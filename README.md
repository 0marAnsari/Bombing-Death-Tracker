An R Shiny Web Application mapping bombings and tracking deaths, using the ACLED API, in Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, and Israel as a result of IDF bombings since October 7th. In addition to the IDF tracker, any data from ACLED about Hamas and Hezbollah actors resulting in any fatalities have been listed.

This is the first iteration of a personal project, I aim for a more ambitious tracker of global interstate and intrastate violence using open-source data. Right now, the point is to track bombing within Gaza, the Southern Border of Lebanon, and the Western side of Syria which the IDF has partially occupied since the fall of the Assad regime. In the face of an uncertain regional future, this application serves as a basic analysis tool to understand state actions as history is forged.

This is to build R-coding skills, shiny expertise, and further understandings of global conflict and the true human toll of warfare.

The database will be updated as soon as ACLED updates the API.
